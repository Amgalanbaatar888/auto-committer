## How it Works

Auto-Committer is a GitHub Action that automates daily commits to your repository. Every day at a scheduled time, it creates a series of empty commits to keep your commit history fresh and active. While the commits are empty and playful in nature, they serve as a motivational reminder to stay committed to your coding endeavors.

## Getting Started

To experience the magic of daily automation, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to make it your own.

2. **Configure the Schedule**: Customize the scheduled time for daily commits in the `.github/workflows/daily_commit.yml` file. By default, commits are scheduled for midnight UTC.

3. **Make it Yours**: Customize the automation to your liking. You can update files, run tests, or add other tasks to the workflow to match your personal project needs.
