# Personal Daily GitHub Automation ðŸ¤–

Welcome to **themuuln's Personal Daily GitHub Automation** project! This repository is designed to bring life and consistency to your GitHub activity through daily automated commits. Stay engaged and enjoy a vibrant coding journey with consistent updates, making your repository an exciting and active place.

## How it Works

Every day at a scheduled time, this project automatically creates a series of empty commits to keep your repository's commit history fresh and active. While the commits are empty and playful in nature, they serve as a motivational reminder to stay committed to your coding endeavors.

## Getting Started

To experience the magic of daily automation, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to make it your own.

2. **Configure the Schedule**: Customize the scheduled time for daily commits in the `.github/workflows/daily_commit.yml` file. By default, commits are scheduled for midnight UTC.

3. **Make it Yours**: Customize the automation to your liking. You can update files, run tests, or add other tasks to the workflow to match your personal project needs.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas to improve the automation or enhance the experience, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
